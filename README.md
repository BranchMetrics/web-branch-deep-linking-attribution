This README outlines the functionality of the Branch Metrics Web SDK, and how to easily incorporate it into a web app.

Live demo: [https://cdn.branch.io/example.html](https://cdn.branch.io/example.html)

## Overview

The Branch Web SDK provides an easy way to interact with the Branch API on your website or web app. It requires no frameworks, and is only ~7K gzipped.

To use the Web SDK, you'll need to first initialize it with your Branch Key found in your [Branch dashboard](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/settings). You'll also need to register when your users login with `setIdentity`, and when they logout with `logout`.

Once initialized, the Branch Web SDK allows you to create and share links with a banner, over SMS, or your own methods. It also offers event tracking, access to referrals, and management of credits.

## Installation

### Requirements

This SDK requires native browser Javascript and has been tested in all modern browsers with sessionStorage capability. No 3rd party libraries are needed to make use of the SDK as is it 100% native Javascript.

### Browser Specific Support
| Chrome | Firefox | Safari |     IE     |
| ------ | ------- | ------ | ---------- |
|    &#10004;   |    &#10004;    |   &#10004;    |  9, 10, 11 |

### Branch Key (formerly App ID)

You will need to create a [Branch Metrics app](http://branch.io) to obtain your Branch Key (you will have the option to toggle between live and test modes).

### Quick Install (Web SDK)

#### Manual installation

_Be sure to replace `BRANCH KEY` with your actual Branch Key found in your [account dashboard](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/settings)._

**[Formerly App ID](CHANGELOG.md)** Note that for the time being, initializing the Web SDK with an App ID will still work, it is strongly recomended you switch to using your live and test API keys.

```html
<script type="text/javascript">

	(function(b,r,a,n,c,h,_,s,d,k){if(!b[n]||!b[n]._q){for(;s<_.length;)c(h,_[s++]);d=r.createElement(a);d.async=1;d.src="https://cdn.branch.io/branch-v1.4.1.min.js";k=r.getElementsByTagName(a)[0];k.parentNode.insertBefore(d,k);b[n]=h}})(window,document,"script","branch",function(b,r){b[r]=function(){b._q.push([r,arguments])}},{_q:[],_v:1},"init data setIdentity logout track link sendSMS referrals credits redeem banner closeBanner".split(" "),0);

	branch.init('BRANCH KEY', function(err, data) {
    	// callback to handle err or data
	});
</script>
```

#### Bower or npm installation

If you use Bower or npm, you can run `bower install branch-sdk` or `npm install branch-sdk` respectively to get the SDK.

#### Common.JS and RequireJS compatibility

In addition to working as a standalone library, the Branch SDK works great in CommonJS environments (browserify, webpack) as well as RequireJS environments (RequireJS/AMD). Just `require('branch')` or `define(['branch'], function(branch) { ... });` to get started!

### Quick Install (Cordova/Phonegap)

This Web SDK can also be used for Cordova/Phonegap applications.  It is provided as a plugin and can be installed with cordova plugin or the plugman tool.  Point the tool at this repositry, https://github.com/BranchMetrics/Web-SDK.git.  For example:

```sh
cordova plugin add https://github.com/BranchMetrics/Web-SDK.git
```

**For a full walktrough specific to integrating the Web SDK with a Cordova app, see the [Cordova Guide](CORDOVA_GUIDE.md).**

Note that this SDK is meant for use with full Cordova/Phonegap apps.  If you are building a hybrid app using an embedded web view and you want to access the Branch API from native code you will want to use the platform specific SDKs and pass data into javascript if needed.

#### Initialization and Event Handling

You should initialize the Branch SDK session once the ‘deviceready’ event fires and each time the ‘resume’ event fires.  See the example code below. You will need your Branch Key from the Branch dashboard.

```js
  branch.init(‘YOUR BRANCH KEY HERE’, function(err, data) {
  	app.initComplete(err, data);
  });
```

The session close will be sent automatically on any ‘pause’ event.

### SDK Method Queue

Initializing the SDK is an asynchronous method with a callback, so it may seem as though you would need to place any method calls that will execute immidiatley inside the `branch.init()` callback. We've made it even easier than that, by building in a queue to the SDK! The only thing that is required is that `branch.init()` is called prior to any other methods. All SDK methods called are gauranteed to : 1. be executed in the order that they were called, and 2. wait to execute until the previous SDK method finishes. Therefore, it is 100% allowable to do something like:
```js
branch.init(...);
branch.banner(...);
```

If `branch.init()` fails, all subsequent branch methods will fail.

### setDebug(debug) 

**Parameters**

**debug**: `boolean`, _required_ - Set the SDK debug flag.

Setting the SDK debug flag will generate a new device ID each time the app is installed
instead of possibly using the same device id.  This is useful when testing.

This needs to be set before the Branch.init call!!!

THIS METHOD IS CURRENTLY ONLY AVAILABLE IN THE CORDOVA/PHONEGAP PLUGIN

---



### init(branch_key, options, callback) 

**Parameters**

**branch_key**: `string`, _required_ - Your Branch [live key](http://dashboard.branch.io/settings), or (depreciated) your app id.

**options**: `Object`, _optional_ - options: isReferrable: Is this a referrable session.

**callback**: `function`, _optional_ - callback to read the session data.

THE "isReferrable" OPTION IS ONLY USED IN THE CORDOVA/PHONEGAP PLUGIN

Adding the Branch script to your page automatically creates a window.branch
object with all the external methods described below. All calls made to
Branch methods are stored in a queue, so even if the SDK is not fully
instantiated, calls made to it will be queued in the order they were
originally called.

The init function on the Branch object initiates the Branch session and
creates a new user session, if it doesn't already exist, in
`sessionStorage`.

**Useful Tip**: The init function returns a data object where you can read
the link the user was referred by.

##### Usage
```js
branch.init(
    branch_key,
    callback (err, data),
    is_referrable
);
```

##### Callback Format
```js
callback(
     "Error message",
     {
          data:               { },      // If the user was referred from a link, and the link has associated data, the data is passed in here.
          referring_identity: '12345', // If the user was referred from a link, and the link was created by a user with an identity, that identity is here.
          has_app:            true,    // Does the user have the app installed already?
          identity:       'BranchUser' // Unique string that identifies the user
     }
);
```

**Note:** `Branch.init` must be called prior to calling any other Branch functions.
___



### data(callback) 

**Parameters**

**callback**: `function`, _optional_ - callback to read the session data.

Returns the same session information and any referring data, as
`Branch.init`, but does not require the `app_id`. This is meant to be called
after `Branch.init` has been called if you need the session information at a
later point.
If the Branch session has already been initialized, the callback will return
immediately, otherwise, it will return once Branch has been initialized.
___



### first(callback) 

**Parameters**

**callback**: `function`, _optional_ - callback to read the session data.

Returns the same session information and any referring data, as
`Branch.init` did when the app was first installed. This is meant to be called
after `Branch.init` has been called if you need the first session information at a
later point.
If the Branch session has already been initialized, the callback will return
immediately, otherwise, it will return once Branch has been initialized.

THIS METHOD IS CURRENTLY ONLY AVAILABLE IN THE CORDOVA/PHONEGAP PLUGIN

___



### setIdentity(identity, callback) 

**Parameters**

**identity**: `string`, _required_ - a string uniquely identifying the user – often a user ID or email address.

**callback**: `function`, _optional_ - callback that returns the user's Branch identity id and unique link.

**[Formerly `identify()`](CHANGELOG.md)**

Sets the identity of a user and returns the data. To use this function, pass
a unique string that identifies the user - this could be an email address,
UUID, Facebook ID, etc.

##### Usage
```js

    identity,
    callback (err, data)
);
```

##### Callback Format
```js
callback(
     "Error message",
     {
          identity_id:        '12345', // Server-generated ID of the user identity, stored in `sessionStorage`.
          link:               'url',   // New link to use (replaces old stored link), stored in `sessionStorage`.
          referring_data:     { },      // Returns the initial referring data for this identity, if exists.
          referring_identity: '12345'  // Returns the initial referring identity for this identity, if exists.
     }
);
```

##### Usage
```js
branch.event(
    event,
    metadata,
    callback (err)
);
```

##### Callback Format
```js

# Deeplinking Methods

## Creating a deep linking link



### link(linkData, callback) 

**Parameters**

**linkData**: `Object`, _required_ - link data and metadata.

**callback**: `function`, _required_ - returns a string of the Branch deep linking URL.

**[Formerly `createLink()`](CHANGELOG.md)**

    linkData,
    callback (err, link)
);
```

#### Example
```js
branch.link({
    tags: [ 'tag1', 'tag2' ],
    channel: 'facebook',
    feature: 'dashboard',
    stage: 'new user',
    type: 1,
    data: {
        mydata: 'something',
        foo: 'bar',
        '$desktop_url': 'http://myappwebsite.com',
        '$ios_url': 'http://myappwebsite.com/ios',
        '$ipad_url': 'http://myappwebsite.com/ipad',
        '$android_url': 'http://myappwebsite.com/android',
        '$og_app_id': '12345',
        '$og_title': 'My App',
        '$og_description': 'My app\'s description.',
        '$og_image_url': 'http://myappwebsite.com/image.png'
    }
}, function(err, link) {
    console.log(err, link);
});
```

##### Callback Format
```js
callback(
    "Error message",
    'https://bnc.lt/l/3HZMytU-BW' // Branch deep linking URL
);
```
___

## Sharing links via SMS



### sendSMS(phone, linkData, options, callback) 

**Parameters**

**phone**: `string`, _required_ - phone number to send SMS to

**linkData**: `Object`, _required_ - object of link data

**options**: `Object`, _optional_ - options: make_new_link, which forces the creation of a new link even if one already exists

**callback**: `function`, _optional_ - Returns an error if unsuccessful

**[Formerly `SMSLink()`](CHANGELOG.md)**

A robust function to give your users the ability to share links via SMS. If
the user navigated to this page via a Branch link, `sendSMS` will send that
same link. Otherwise, it will create a new link with the data provided in
the `params` argument. `sendSMS` also  registers a click event with the
`channel` pre-filled with `'sms'` before sending an sms to the provided
`phone` parameter. This way the entire link click event is recorded starting
with the user sending an sms.

**Note**: `sendSMS` will *automatically* send a previously generated link click,
along with the `data` object in the original link. Therefore, it is unneccessary for the
`data()` method to be called to check for an already existing link. If a link already
exists, `sendSMS` will simply ignore the `data` object passed to it, and send the existing link.
If this behaivior is not desired, set `make_new_link: true` in the `options` object argument
of `sendSMS`, and `sendSMS` will always make a new link.

**Supports international SMS**.

#### Usage
```js
branch.sendSMS(
    phone,
    linkData,
    options,
    callback (err, data)
);
```

##### Example
```js
branch.sendSMS(
    phone: '9999999999',
    {
        tags: ['tag1', 'tag2'],
        channel: 'facebook',
        feature: 'dashboard',
        stage: 'new user',
        type: 1,
        data: {
            mydata: 'something',
            foo: 'bar',
            '$desktop_url': 'http://myappwebsite.com',
            '$ios_url': 'http://myappwebsite.com/ios',
            '$ipad_url': 'http://myappwebsite.com/ipad',
            '$android_url': 'http://myappwebsite.com/android',
            '$og_app_id': '12345',
            '$og_title': 'My App',
            '$og_description': 'My app\'s description.',
            '$og_image_url': 'http://myappwebsite.com/image.png'
        }
    },
    { make_new_link: true }, // Default: false. If set to true, sendSMS will generate a new link even if one already exists.
    function(err) { console.log(err); }
});
```

##### Callback Format
```js
callback("Error message");
```

THIS METHOD IS CURRENTLY ONLY AVAILABLE IN THE WEB SDK NOT THE CORDOVA/PHONEGAP PLUGIN

# Referral system rewarding functionality
In a standard referral system, you have 2 parties: the original user and the invitee. Our system is flexible enough to handle rewards for all users for any actions. Here are a couple example scenarios:
1. Reward the original user for taking action (eg. inviting, purchasing, etc)
2. Reward the invitee for installing the app from the original user's referral link
3. Reward the original user when the invitee takes action (eg. give the original user credit when their the invitee buys something)

These reward definitions are created on the dashboard, under the 'Reward Rules' section in the 'Referrals' tab on the dashboard.

Warning: For a referral program, you should not use unique awards for custom events and redeem pre-identify call. This can allow users to cheat the system.

## Retrieve referrals list



### referrals(callback)

# Smart App Sharing Banner

The Branch Web SDK has a built in sharing banner, that automatically displays a device specific banner for desktop, iOS, and Android. If the banner is shown on a desktop, a form for sending yourself the download link via SMS is shown.
Otherwise, a button is shown that either says an "open" app phrase, or a "download" app phrase, based on whether or not the user has the app installed. Both of these phrases can be specified in the parameters when calling the banner function.
**Styling**: The banner automatically styles itself based on if it is being shown on the desktop, iOS, or Android.



### banner(options, linkData) 

**Parameters**

**options**: `Object`, _required_ - object of all the options to setup the banner

**linkData**: `Object`, _required_ - object of all link data, same as Branch.link()

**[Formerly `appBanner()`](CHANGELOG.md)**

Display a smart banner directing the user to your app through a Branch referral link.  The `linkData` param is the exact same as in `branch.link()`.

| iOS Smart Banner | Android Smart Banner | Desktop Smart Banner |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| ![iOS Smart Banner](docs/images/ios-web-sdk-banner-1.0.0.png) | ![Android Smart Banner](docs/images/android-web-sdk-banner-1.0.0.png) | ![Desktop Smart Banner](docs/images/desktop-web-sdk-banner-1.0.0.png) |

THIS METHOD IS ONLY AVAILABLE IN THE WEB SDK NOT IN THE CORDOVA/PHONEGAP PLUGIN

#### Usage

```js
branch.banner(
    options, // Banner options: See example for all available options
    linkData // Data for link, same as Branch.link()

### closeBanner()

#### Closing the App Banner Programmatically

The App Banner includes a close button the user can click, but you may want to close the banner with a timeout, or via some
other user interaction with your web app. In this case, closing the banner is very simple by calling `Branch.closeBanner()`.

##### Usage
```js
branch.closeBanner();
```
